/**
 * A simple key-value store that can be iterated and stores only weak references to its keys.
 * This could be implemented directly by `WeakHashMap` on JVM, but JS's `WeakMap` type is not
 * iterable so it needs a custom implementation. This class is used on the JVM as well for
 * consistency.
 *
 * The implementation is built on three primitives, which exist in both JVM and JS:
 * 1. A weak reference type.
 * 2. A weak map that only supports get/set.
 * 3. A strongly-referenced linked list.
 *
 * The map is weakly-keyed by the actual key type, and values are "value holder" objects that hold
 * both the value and a weak reference to the key. This means all references to keys are weak.
 * Each element of the list stores a weak reference to a value holder.
 *
 * ## Operations
 *
 * - The get operation is supported by simply querying the map.
 * - The set operation checks if the key is already in the map, and:
 *    - If present, updates the value in the value holder.
 *    - Else, adds a new value holder and links it into the list.
 * - Iteration is supported by iterating over the list and ignoring elements whose weak references
 *  to their holder is invalid.
 *
 * ## Cleanup
 *
 * The weak map is kept clean by the underlying implementation â€“ keys that are GC'd are
 * automatically removed from the map. Because the only _strong_ reference to the holder objects is
 * from the map, when a key is GC'd, its value holder is also automatically GC'd.
 *
 * To remove GC'd entries from the list however, there are two processes that amortize the work.
 * - Every time a get or set operation is performed an element from the list is checked for validity
 *  and removed if necessary. This is a constant-time operation, since only a single element is
 *  checked.
 * - Whenever the entire list is walked by [forEach], all elements whose holder has been GC'd are
 *  removed from the list as the traversal is happening. This involves no additional iteration since
 *  the entire list is being traversed anyway.
 *
 * The amortized cleanup is implemented by a single pointer to the next element to check. On every
 * step, either an element is removed, or the pointer is advanced to the next element. When the end
 * of the list is reached, the pointer is reset to the head of the list.
